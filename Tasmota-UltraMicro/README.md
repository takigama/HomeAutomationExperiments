# The Tasmota Ultra Micro

Like the Tasmota Micro, but smaller.

## Minimal.

I made it so I could put together some small sensor boards that plug straight into
a USB port. Unlike the original Tasmota Micro, this one has only a 'reg and direct
inputs to the GPIO's of the ESP8266 ESP01 board.

## Thanks...

Thanks to the tasmota guys for making the awesome firmware!
